# Session 3: Embedding Content

## Overview
In the previous session, we introduced some basic HTML for content. In it, we introduced the `a` tag which is a big part of the magic of linking different chunks of HTML together to create the <b>ðŸŽº WORLD WIDE WEB ðŸŽº</b>. Another big part is the ability to embed other content into HTML like images, audio, and video.

In this session we'll introduce how to embed these types of content into your HTML and showcase some other common embed types you might run into in the wild.

### Links
Links (officially known as *hyperlinks*) are a foundational concept on the web. When interacted with (clicked, etc) they can take you to a new piece of content or website. The tag we use to make a hyperlink is the `a` tag. 

In the most common usage, they require a `href` *attribute*. The `href` attribute (standing for *hypertext reference*) is the `url` to where you want the user to navigate to when clicking the link. 


Example:
```
Visit <a href="https://www.mplsart.com">MPLSART</a> to find local art events.
```

This renders as:
> Visit <a href="https://www.mplsart.com">MPLSART</a> to find local art events.

Notes:
 - By default, browsers will render the content of the `a` tag with an underline and typically with a blue font color.
 - The value of the `href` attribute should start with *https://* or similar. It is a common mistake to use, for example, *www.example.com/...* or simply *example.com/...*, however these links will not take you to the expected location. We'll cover the ins and outs of url in another section.
 * More advanced usage of hyperlinks and the `a` tag are covered in a future section.


### Line Breaks
The `br` tag is used to visually force a line break within content. It has no real semantic meaning. In most HTML editors (Wordpress, etc), pressing the *SHIFT - ENTER* key will create a new `br`. Note, the `br` tag cannot contain any *children*.

Example:
```
Line 1<br />
Line 2
```
> Line 1<br />
Line 2

## Less Commonly Used Formatting

There are many other less commonly used HTML tags for basic contant formatting. As you might run into several of these in "the wild", we'll list them out here. 

## Delete and Insert 
Semantically, the `del` tag is used to designate content that is intended to be removed but remains in the document. In practice, browsers will render this text with a horizontal line through it.

Example: 
```
<del>This text should be removed.</del>
```
> <del>This text should be removed.</del>

Similarly, the `ins` tag is intended to designate text that should be inserted.

```
<ins>This text should be removed.</ins>
```
> <ins>This text should be removed.</ins>

Note: As with the `b` and `i` tags, alternatives to the `del` are `s` and `strike`. While `del` has a semantic meaning, it is typically used to simply render text with a visual strikethrough. 

## Superscript and Subscript 
The `sup` and `sub` tags are used to visually render text as *superscript* and *subscript* respectively. In practice these are used to display mathematical formulas (eg. exponents) or to visually create footnotes. They are sometimes incorrectly used to make smaller text.

Example:
```
2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 31
The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993<sub> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">1</a></sub> 
```
>2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 31
>
>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993<sub><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">1</a></sub> 

## Quotations
To capture the semantic meaning When displaying a quote, use the `blockquote` tag for long quotes and `q` for shorter quotes. Browsers will typically display the former with an indent and display the later wrapped in quote marks.

Example:
```
<blockquote>Pretend this is a long quote from your favorite author.</blockquote>

Some argue HTML is <q>a programming language</q>, but life is too short to argue about such things.
```

Example of `blockquote`:
> <blockquote>Pretend this is a long quote from your favorite author.</blockquote>
>

Example of `q`:
> Some argue HTML is <q>a programming language</q>, but life is too short to argue about such things.

## More Complex Tags
The above tags are primarily focused on text formatting. The following introduce some other common tags.

## Paragraphs and Containers
There are three primary container tags - each with different meanings.

### Spans
The `span` tag is a simple wrapper tag. It doesn't impose any semantic meaning nor have any visual styling on its own. It is used to contain logically similar text and tags and usually used to apply css styling. It may contain any of the above text formatting tags including links, etc. 

Example:
```
<span>This is a bit of text</span><span>This is a bit of text</span>
```
> <span>This is a bit of text</span><span>This is a bit of text</span>

### Div
The `div` tag is much like the span tag in that it is a wrapper with no real semantic meaning. However, unlike the `span` tag, it does create a visual line break after the contents.

Example:
```
<div>This is a block of text</div><div>This is a block of text</div>
```
> <div>This is a block of text</div><div>This is a block of text</div>


### Paragraphs
The `p` tag is used to designate its contents as a logical paragraph of text. It may contain any of the above text formatting tags including links, etc. It may contain `span` tags but not `div` tags. By default, the paragraph tag creates a visual line break after its contents. In most HTML editors (Wordpress, etc), pressing the *ENTER* key will create a new `p`.

Example:
```
<p>This is block of text</p>
<p>This is <i>another<i> block of text</p>
```
> <p>This is block of text</p>
> <p>This is <i>another<i> block of text</p>

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
The `ul` tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list. The children of a `ul` should be one ore more `li` (list item) tags.

```
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```
><ul>
>  <li>Item 1</li>
>  <li>Item 2</li>
></ul>




### Ordered Lists
Ordered lists behave the same as unordered lists, but assume that the child `li` elements have an important order that is visually displayed.
```
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```
><ol>
>  <li>Item 1</li>
>  <li>Item 2</li>
></ol>

The starting number and the bullet can be visually controlled via the *start* and *type* attribute respectively. 


```
<ol type="I" start="10">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```
><ol type="I" start="10">
>  <li>Item 1</li>
>  <li>Item 2</li>
></ol>

Note: The *type* attribute can be any of:
 - 1 decimal numbers
 - A - uppercase letters
 - a - lowercase letters
 - I - uppercase roman numerals
 - i - lowercase roman numerals
