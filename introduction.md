## Who is This For?
This course was designed with non-profit admins in mind. It will give you the skills you need to your job better without assuming you want to be a software engineer. Do you have an art history degree but find yourself tasked with updating your organization's website? Do you need to answer questions about your organization's membership trends but are maxing out the capabilities of spreadsheets?  Then this course is for you!

This course work is designed in layers to incrementally build and reinforce your understanding. This course also tries to give you the "why" without getting too lost in technical detail or history. 

<br />

## What this course is not
This course is not a replacement for a computer science or related degree. Nor is it a replacement for a code book camp. It also is not an exhaustive resource.
