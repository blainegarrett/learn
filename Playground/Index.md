  These are the rules of the playground:
  <ol type="a" start="a">
    <li> No running </li>
    <li> No fun-having </li>
    <li> Abolutely no yelling, especially:
      <ul>
        <li> Swear words </li>
        <li> Mean names </li>
      </ul>
    <li> No crying </li>
  </ol>
  These rules may seem a bit over the top, but we pride ourselves on giving parents a premium playground experience - at our playground, you'll never hear the tired begging of <q>Walk! Walk!</q> or <q>Susie, use your inside voice!</q>, you won't have a headache echoing with the wails of an injured child. And we guarantee your child will <strong>never</strong> come home with a new, forbidden vocabulary word learned from miscreants blocking the tunnel slide.</ br>
