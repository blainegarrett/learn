# Introduction

In this series, we will learn practical skills for interacting with databases. The focus of the first part of the series will be on interacting with existing databases to query them and learn approaches to gather insight.


## What is a Database?
Loosly defined, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. A spreadsheet could be considered a database as could a website. However, more commonly, databases refer to a specific system of data storage and retrival. These typically run on their own server and are specifically optimized for data retrival and often complex querying. 


## Types of Databases
There are several types of databases - the most popular include *relational* databases, *document/object* databases and *graph* databases. Each exist to address a specific problem. For this series, we will focus specicifically on relational databases.

## What is a Relational Database
Relational databases may contain multiple *tables* consisting of rows of data. These tables can *relate* to each other in various ways that allow us to perform powerful queries and maintain data integrity. 

## POSTGRES
Through this series, we will be using a *PostGres* database as the specific relational database. Along with MySQL, Amazon's Aurora DB, and others, PostGres follows a standard for relational databases and what we learn here should apply to all relational databases with minor syntax nuance.
